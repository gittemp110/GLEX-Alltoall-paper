\section{Related Work}

From an algorithm perspective: Bruck algorithm \cite{bruck1997efficient} is commonly used for small message all-to-all. For mid size messages, isend-irecv algorithm is used. For large messages, linear shift exchange \cite{ranka1994static}, pairwise exchange\cite{thakur2005optimization}.

When considering the multi-core processors:  
Cache-oblivious MPI all-to-all (SH-NUMA-CO) based on morton order is proposed to minimize the cache miss rate \cite{li2017cache}.
For Infiniband and multi-core systems, a all-to-all collective (SA-orig) which based on shared memory aggregation techniques is proposed in \cite{kumar2008scaling}.
For multi-rail QsNet SMP clusters, a shared memory and RDMA based all-to-all collectives (elan\_alltoall) is proposed in \cite{qian2008efficient}.
For Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture,  the re-routing scheme based all-to-all collective (PAIRWISE-SLR/BRUCK-SLR) is proposed in \cite{venkatesh2014high}. 
These works are direct related to our work. 
Table 1 shows the overall design-space for all-to-all collective on mulit-core processers.
